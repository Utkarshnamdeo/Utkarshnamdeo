# Hi, I'm Utkarsh Namdeo

Senior Frontend Engineer based in Berlin, building user focused digital products with React, TypeScript, and modern web architectures.  
I care deeply about **product thinking**, **engineering excellence**, and building systems that scale both technically and in real user value.

## About me

I’ve spent almost eight years creating web applications across industries, countries, and teams — starting as a full stack engineer in fast moving agencies, volunteering as a developer in South America, and later leading frontend engineering for award winning digital products in Germany.

My work has contributed to companies reaching acquisition milestones, winning international UX awards, and shipping mission critical features that impact thousands of users.

Over the years, I’ve moved from obsessing over “perfect code” to understanding something far more important:  
**A product only matters when users actually use it.**  
Clean systems and strong engineering culture support that mission, but the end goal is always delivering real value to real people, on time.

## My thought process and philosophy

- I believe **product impact outweighs aesthetic code**, but clean abstractions and sustainable engineering accelerate product delivery.  
- I value **clarity over cleverness** — readable, predictable systems outperform overengineered ones.  
- I advocate for **designing for change**, not just designing for the current sprint.  
- I see developers as **product collaborators**, not “ticket solvers”.  
- I ship fast, validate early, and improve continuously.  
- I care deeply about **user experience**, **performance**, and the hidden cost of complexity.  
- I follow a simple rule: *build what matters, polish what lasts, remove what doesn’t help*.

## What I’ve achieved so far

- Built core frontend applications that contributed to a company acquisition valued at **over 100 million euros**.  
- Led the frontend development of an application that won **UX Design Award** and **German Brand Award**.  
- Represented a mission driven startup on **national TV in Colombia** while building tech that helped women and single mothers run home based businesses.  
- Started and scaled frontend systems from scratch across multiple companies, including monorepo setups, design systems, and application rewrites.  
- Delivered production critical features across Germany, India, and South America, consistently balancing speed, quality, and product priorities.  
- Grown into a senior engineer known for high ownership, strong communication, and reliable delivery under pressure.

## My favorite tech stack

I enjoy working with tools that balance power and simplicity.

- **React 19**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Vite**  
- **React Query**  
- **Framer Motion**  
- **Firebase & Cloudflare**  
- **Node.js / Express**  
- **Monorepo tooling (Turborepo / Nx)**  
- **Shadcn UI**  
- **React Native** (experience from Elenas and other mobile projects)

I value frameworks that:  
→ reduce friction  
→ scale with complexity  
→ encourage maintainability  
→ keep the developer experience enjoyable

## Work ethics and how I operate

- High ownership mindset — I treat products like my own.  
- I communicate early, proactively, and transparently.  
- I solve problems, not just implement tickets.  
- I keep things simple unless complexity is justified.  
- I mentor and uplift teams whenever possible.  
- I strive for calm engineering culture and reliable shipping.  
- I deliver even under ambiguity and incomplete requirements.  
- I continuously learn and refine my craft.

These values have shaped how I build, collaborate, and lead projects across teams.
